## Introduction
This README provides an overview of a coding test that consists of three different questions. The document aims to explain the objectives and high-level solutions for each task without delving into the specifics of the code.

## Question 6-1: Palindrome Checker

### Objective:
The goal is to determine if a given word is a palindrome. If the word is not a palindrome, the function returns the word in reverse order.

**Example**: 
The word "hello" isn't a palindrome, so the function would return "olleh".

### Solution Overview:
The function first reverses the input string and then checks if the reversed string is the same as the original. If they match, it confirms the word as a palindrome; otherwise, it returns the reversed string.

## Question 6-2: Find Missing Number

### Objective:
Given an array that contains the first 45 integers with one of them missing, the task is to determine which integer is missing.

### Solution Overview:
The solution involves creating an array of the first 45 numbers. One number is deliberately removed to simulate the problem. The solution then iteratively checks each position in the array to determine which number is missing.

## Question 6-3: Digital Clock

### Objective:
The goal is to develop a digital clock using JavaScript that can display the current time in a 12-hour format.

### Solution Overview:
The solution obtains the current time, breaks it down into hours, minutes, and seconds, and then formats it into a 12-hour format with AM/PM indications. The clock updates every second to keep the displayed time current.
